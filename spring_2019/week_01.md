## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Learned the basics of HTML and some basic Javascript using w3schools.  Read through the 
> entirety of the Tutorial sections for both of these on the site.  

## This Week's Plan

> This weeks plan is to polish up my knowledge of javascript and to familiarize myslef with CSS 
> to the point where I can work with it to improve the website.  This will be done using the w3schools site
> to gaain a foundation on CSS.

## Anything Blocking?

> The lack of CSS experience is currently a blocker as it is needed to contribute to the website, 
> but this should be mitigated following this week.
